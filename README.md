# 🩺 Stroke Prediction Using Random Forest Classification  

## 🔍 Overview  
This project employs **machine learning** techniques to predict the likelihood of stroke occurrences based on health-related features such as:  
- Age  
- Gender  
- Hypertension  
- Heart Disease  
- Smoking Status  
- Average Glucose Levels  

By leveraging the **Random Forest algorithm**, the goal is to develop a highly accurate and interpretable model to assist healthcare professionals in proactive stroke risk assessment and intervention strategies.
